**ccChatBox** is a [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) addon for
[ComputerCraft](http://computercraft.info/) that adds a peripheral block
which allows CC computers to interact with server-wide chat.


## Compiling ##

To compile this mod, you will need a working MCP + Forge +
[MCPDeobfuscate](https://github.com/FunnyMan3595/mcp_deobfuscate) install with
[MCPInterface](https://github.com/FunnyMan3595/mcp_interface) plugged in.
Instructions for that are in the README.txt files provided in the projects.

You will also need to provide Tinker's Construct, either as a library or as a
project dependency. The former is probably easier.


## Jenkins Builds ##

Builds for Minecraft 1.6 live at
<http://ci.narc.ro/view/Forge-1.6/job/ccChatBox-1.6/>. Any later supported
versions will probably get their own job.
